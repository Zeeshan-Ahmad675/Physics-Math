        <h2 id="Introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            In our everyday-life, we encounter three quantities - <b>Scalars, Vectors</b> and <b>Higher rank Tensors</b>. To say, Scalar and Vectors are zero and 1st rank tensors, respectively. But, we won't be discussing higher rank tensors here.
            <br/><br/>

            <ul class="mainlist">
                <li id="Scalars"><b><u>Scalars</u>:</b></li>

                <p>
                    <b>Definition: </b>Scalars are the quantities which have only magnitudes but no direction.
                
                    <br/>
                    
                    For example, distance, speed, charge, volume, mass, numbers etc.

                    <br/><br/>
                    
                    Now, we can perform additon, subtraction, multiplication and divison on the scalars <i>in the same way we perform these operations on numbers (algebriac operations)</i>. Let us consider two scalar values, say \(5C\) and \(-1C\) of charges, where \(C\) is Coulomb.

                    <br/><br/>

                    If they are put together, then we say that \((5-1)C= 4C\), of charge is at that place.

                    Similarly, other operations are performed.

                </p>

                <br/><br/>

                <li id="Vectors"><b><u>Vectors</u>:</b></li>


                <p>
                    <b>Definition:</b> Vectors are any physical quantity which have direction as well as magnitude.

                    <br/>
                    For example, displacement, velocity, force, angular speed, etc.

                    <br/><br/> Let's take the example of force. When we push an object with a force, we can feel how hard we are pushing it. This is in a sense a measure of <b>magnitude</b> of the force. Further, we can push the object from different directions as shown in <a href="#img1.1">Figure 1.1</a>, this is the <b>direction</b> of the force.

                    </div>
                    

                    
                    <p>
                        Vectors are <b>denoted</b> by a boldface letter such as \(\textbf{A}\) or with an arrow on head of the letter i.e. as \(\vec{A}\). We would take up the arrow on head notation in rest of the discussion. In <b>diagrams</b>, we represent vectors using arrows, such that its magnitude (denoted as \(|\vec{A}|\) or simply \(A\)) is proportional to the length of arrow and direction indicated by the head of the arrow.
                        This can be seen in the <a href="#img1.1">Figure 1.1</a>.
                        <br/><br/>

                        
                    </p>

                </p>

                <ul class="c1ul">
                    <li><b><u>Equal vectors and Opposite/ Negative Vectors</u>:</b></li>

                    <p>
                        Two vectors \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) are said to be equal iff the have they same magnitude as well as direction, as shown in <a href="#img1.2">Figure 1.2</a>.

                        We have to find the difference \(\vec{a}-\vec{b}\). So, we rewrite it as \((\vec{a}+(-\vec{b}))\). And clearly, this represents the diagonal of the parallelogram formed by \(\vec{a}\) and \(-\vec{b}\) as its resultant, as shown in figure.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since, here the angle between \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\) is \(\theta\), so the angle between \(\vec{a}\) and \(-\vec{b}\) (the vectors which originally have to be "added") would be \((\pi-\theta)\). Now, using the equation <a href="#eq2.1">2.1</a> for the magnitude of \(\vec{R}\), we get:

                       R &= \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos\theta}\\

                       (\because \cos(\pi-\theta) &= -\cos{\theta})
                    \end{align}

                    <p>
                        If you have noticed, we have taken the magnitude of the negative vector, \(-\vec{b}\) to be the same \(b\). This is because the length of the vector remains the same even after negating it. The angle \(\phi\) that gives the direction of \(\vec{R}\) is calculated in the same way as is done above.

                    Anyway, we can genralize it to be \(x\) vectors along the \(x\)-axis and \(y\) vectors along the \(y\)-axis. The two vectors are known as <b><a href="#">Basis vectors</a></b> for \(2D\) plane and are denoted as \(\hat{i}\) (or \(\hat{x}\)) for basis along \(x\)-axis and \(\hat{j}\) (or \(\hat{y}\)) for that along \(y\)-axis (see <a href="#img3.1">figure</a>).

                <p>
                    A question rises here. How do we know exactly how much vectors (of a particular length, generally 1 unit) is needed along each of the axes to get the desired vector?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is that either we need to know <i>the coordinates of the point</i>, \(A\) to which the vector is going from the origin OR we need to know the <i>angles made by the vector with each of the axes considered and the length of the vector \(\vec{A}\)</i>. 
                    The coordinates method is quite simple, as this is how we define the coordinates of a point. So, let's see the angle method. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the vector \(\vec{A}\) makes an angle theta with the \(x\)-axis, then from \(\triangle OAB\):

                    $$
                        \text{OB} = A\cos{\theta} \quad\&\quad \text{AB} = A\sin{\theta}
                    $$

                    But, \(\text{OB} = x\) and \(\text{AB} = y\), so:

                    $$
                        x = A\cos{\theta}, \quad y = A\sin{\theta} = A\cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)},
                    $$
                    where, \((\pi/2-\theta)\) is the angle made by the vector and the \(y\)-axis. This shows that knowing the angle with the axes and lenght of the vector does indeed lets us know how many vectors are required along each axis, in \(2\) dimensions. An extension of this to \(3\) dimensions would be discussed in the <a href="#directional_cosines">Directional Cosines</a> section.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One notable thing here is that \(A\cos{\theta}\) and \(A\sin{\theta}\) are known as the projection of the vector \(\vec{A}\) along the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis respectively.

                    <p>
                        We would have to say about projection <a href="#dot_product">later on</a> too, still let's have an idea of what exactly projecting means. When we say the vector is projected on an axis, we imagine a line drawn perpendicular to the axis (say, \(x\)-axis) from the head of the vector, as \(\text{AB}\) in <a href="#img3.1">Figure 3.1</a>. Then, the length of the segment from the tail of the vector to the bottom of the perpendicular line along the axis, here \(\text{OA}\) is know as <i>projection of the vector</i> of that axis.
                    </p>

                <hr>

                <p>
                    From here, we would assume that the coordinates of point to which the vector is drawn from origin is given, instead of its length and angles, unless otherwise stated.

                    <p>
                        Till now, we have been talking of the basis vectors as abstract objects and haven't quantified them yet. In \(2D\), basis can be any two vectors pointing in different directions (for datails, see <a href="https://math.physicsderived.club/chapters/linear_algebra" class="extlink">Linear Algebra</a> on <a href="https://math.physicsderived.club" class="extlink">Math Derived</a>). But to make the calculations easy and to maintain some standard of vector representation, we have defined the basis as: 

                        <ul class="norli">
                            <li>
                                \(\hat{i}\) : The vector representing the arrow from the origin, \((0, 0)\) to the point \((1, 0)\) in the \(xy\)-plane.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                \(\hat{j}\) : The vector representing the arrow from the origin, \((0, 0)\) to the point \((0, 1)\) in the \(xy\)-plane.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        These are known as the <i>Standard basis</i> in two dimensions, refer the <a href="#img3.1">Figure 3.1</a>. See <a href="#Unit_vector">Unit vector</a> below for the symbol.
                    </p>

                    <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
                        Let's write down the above vector \(\vec{A}\) in this representation, using the standard basis. In this representation, the vector is written as the sum of multiples (as much as used in making the vector) of the basis vectors. This makes the calculation very easy and intuitive as we will see shortly. So, the vector \(\vec{A}\) is:

                        $$
                            \vec{A} = 8\hat{i} + 4\hat{j}
                        $$
                    </p>

                    <p id="eq3.1">
                        This is for the particular vector going from the origin to the point \((8, 4)\). For any general vector from origin to point \((x, y)\), the representation gives: 

                        $$
                            \boxed{\vec{A} = x\hat{i} + y\hat{j}} \hspace{1cm} \color{red}{(3.1)}
                        $$
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This representation is known as the basis vector representation since we are writing the vector in terms of the basis vectors. Further, it is known as the component form since the components of a particular vector about the axes is explicitly shown in this represenatation. Here, the components of \(\vec{A}\) are \(x\) about the \(x\)-axis and \(y\) about the \(y\)-axis.

                    The above analysis can be easily generalized to three dimensions. We consider a vector (in arrow form, say \(\vec{A}\)) from the origin, \((0, 0, 0)\) to the point \((x, y, z)\). Also, a new basis vector along the \(z\)-axis is taken, as described below (refer <a href="#img3.2">Figure 3.2</a>):

                    $$

                <p>
                    It is instructive to calculate the magnitude of the basis vectors. This seamlessly comes out to be \(1\) unit i.e. 

                    $$
                    \begin{align}
                        |\hat{i}| = |\hat{j}| = |\hat{k}| = 1
                    \end{align}
                    $$

                    So, the standard basis vectors are "<i>unit vectors</i>" (a vector with magnitude \(1\) unit). A standard symbol for a unit vector is  caret \((\;\hat{}\;)\) over the name of the vector, such as \(\hat{i}\) (read as \(i\text{ hat})\). This is what we would be using for symbolizing unit vectors throughout our analysis (except otherwise stated).

Finally, we draw the resultant vector. But, in the component form, we just need to do the algebraic addition for the components and, lo and behold, we got the <a href="#eq3.4">resultant vector</a>.

                    <p>
                        Anyway, it should be emphasized that both the forms of addition are important and we are not showing one above the another. It is just the situation under which we are performing addition, which makes this apparent scenario of better form of addition.

                        A similar thing as above has happened here too. The vector \(\vec{B}\) "drags" the vector \(\vec{A}\) towards itself by the same amount as its coordinates. The \(2D\) drag can be explicity seen on the \(xy\)-plane: the projection of vector \(\vec{A}\) on the plane i.e. \(a(A_x, A_y, 0)\) is dragged by the projection of \(\vec{B}\) i.e. \(f(B_x, B_y, 0)\) to make it \(b(A_x + B_x, A_y + B_y, 0)\), which is the projection of the final vector \(\vec{A} + \vec{B}\). All of this is backed by the <a href="#Triangle_Law">Triangle Law</a> (see the  \(\triangle oed\) in <a href="#img3.4">figure</a>, which utilizes the triangle law of vector addition to add the two vectors).

The \(z\)-component of \(\vec{A}\) was at point \(e(A_x, A_y, A_z)\) which get "dragged" to the point \(d(A_x + B_x, A_y + B_y, A_z + B_z)\), by the vector \(\vec{B}\text{'s}\) \(z\)-component, which lies at \(g(B_x, B_y, B_z)\). Which is to say: \(cd = fg\). One last thing worth mentioning is that: all the things discussed here can be done equally well in terms of \(\vec{A}\) dragging the components of \(\vec{B}\).

                        If you noticed, we used the vector arrow on zero above in the analysis, as \(\vec{0}\). This is known as the <i>'Null Vector'</i>.

Since, <a href="#Addition_of_Vectors">vector addition</a> gives <a href="#Magnitude_and_Direction_of_Resultant">resultant</a> as a vector, we need to put an arrow over zero to show that it is a vector with magnitude zero.

            <p>
                Although, there are many different multiplications for vectors in Mathematics, only three different multiplications defined on vectors have important roles in Physics. Let's discuss them in detail.
            </p>

            <li id="Multiplication_with_scalar"><b><u>Multiplication with scalar</u>:</b></li>

            <p>
                Consider a vector \(\vec{A}\) and a scalar \(c\). When we multiply a vector with a scalar, we effectively scale that vector by a factor of \(c\). That is, the resultant vector, \(c\vec{A}\) is in the direction of \(\vec{A}\), but has a length of \(c|\vec{A}|\).

            </div>

            <p>
                In the adjacent image, <a href="#img4.1">Figure 4.1</a>, the scalar multiplied by the vector \(\vec{A}\) is \(c = 2\). So, the resultant vector, \(2\vec{A}\) is in the direction of \(\vec{A}\) itself but have double the magnitude as indicated by its length.
            </p>

            <p>
                What we are doing here isn't anything new. Actually we have been doing this for a while in this chapter, starting right <a href="#eq3.1">from here</a>. To give a similar example, let \(\vec{A} = \hat{i}\) and \(c = 2.5\), as indicated in the right diagram of <a href="#img4.1">Figure 4.1</a>. Then, the resultant vector, \((2.5)\hat{i} = 5/2\hat{i}\) is in the direction of \(\hat{i}\) i.e. along the \(x\)-axis (if we consider our <a href="#standard_3D_basis">standard basis</a>) and is \(2.5\) times \(1\text{ unit}\) (the length of \(\hat{i}\)).

            <br/>

            <p>
                Only two different types of product on two vectors have prominent use in Physics. These are:

                    Consider two vectors, \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) with an angle \(\theta\) in between them (see <a href="#Magnitude_and_Direction_of_Resultant">angle between two vectors</a>), on acute side as shown in the <a href="#img4.2">Figure 4.2</a>. Then, the <i>Dot Product</i> of \(\vec{A}\) and \(\vec{B}\) is defined as: 

                    $$

It is represented by placing a dot\((\cdot)\) in between the vectors, hence the name. Also, the resulting quantity is itself a scalar, so, <i> Dot Product</i> is often called as <i>Scalar Product</i> too.

                    <li><b><u>Interpretation</u>:</b></li>

                    <p>
                        The interpretation of dot product is simple. From <a href="#img4.2">Figure 4.2</a>, the projection of \(\vec{A}\) in the direction of \(\vec{B}\) is \(A\cos{\theta}\) and vice versa. So, the dot product of two vectors is the projection of one vector along the direction of other times the magnitude of the other vector. This interpretation in itself reveals the uses of dot product in Physics. One of them, and the most famous one is calculating work done by a force.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The work done by a force \(\vec{F}\) in moving a body in a direction at angle \(\theta\) with itself, a distance \(d\) is given as: 

                        $$
                            W = Fd\cos{\theta}.
                        $$
                    </p>

                    <p class="clrb">
                        If, the vector \(\vec{d}\) represents the displacement of the body in the specified direction and magnitude, then we get: 

                        $$
                            W = Fd\cos{\theta} \implies W = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{d}
                        $$
                        
                        Similarly, dot product arise in many other physical situation, when we try to analyse them. Actually, this is the reason why even a "Dot Product" exists for vectors. So many expressions have the term of the form \(ab\cos{\theta}\), that a notation \(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\) was introduced to make the expressions compact and more interpretable.

                            The dot product can't be associative, in such a way that it never fulfills the criteria to give the equation of associativity such as \(a\times (b\times c)\), given by scalar numbers. The reasoning for this is:

                        <p>
                            Since, the dot product of two vectors is always a scalar, the equation of the form:

                            $$
                            \vec{A}\cdot(\vec{B}\cdot\vec{C}) = \vec{A}\cdot(\text{Scalar})

                            would never make sense, since the dot product is defined only between two vectors and not between a vector and a scalar.

                    <p id="eq4.4">
                        For any two parallel vectors, say \(\vec{a}\) and \(\vec{b}\), \(\theta=0\). So, the dot product of the two gives: 

                        $$
                            \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos{(0)} \implies \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = ab.
                        $$


                        A special case arises when \(\vec{a} = \vec{b}\). Then, the dot product of \(\vec{a}\) with itself would be: 

                        $$
                        \begin{align}
                            \vec{a} \cdot\vec{a} &= a^2 \qquad \color{red}{(4.4)}
                        \end{align}
                        $$
                        
                        So, the dot product of a vector with itself is equal to the magnitude squared of the vector. It has a very useful implication for unit vectors, as we will soon see. But first, let us consider the situation in which \(\theta = \pi/2\) i.e. dot product of orthogonal vectors. Here, 

                        $$
                            \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|\cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)} = 0.
                        $$
                        
                        
                        So, the dot product of orthogonal vectors is always zero. Actually, <b>to check if two vectors are othogonal</b>, we generally check if their dot product is zero. One might get confused here that if we doesn't know the angle between the two vectors, how would we even compute the dot product between them to check for orthogonality. This is where we are now heading.
